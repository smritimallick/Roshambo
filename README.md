# Roshambo - Rock Paper Scissors Game 

Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game originating from China that is usually played between two people.
In this each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched i.e., "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

I've built this using `tkinter` package in python. Tkinter is basically used to create the Graphical User Interface (GUI) which we've used for our
game, through which the user can interact with the system and choose from the available options.

I've also incorporated `pillow` library that will allow the python interpretor with image editing capabilities.

Since, this game is played against a computer. I've imported the `randint` module from the random library where the computer will be 
able to choose from the available options randomly.

### To run this program:

Usually, Tkinter comes pre-installed with the Python installer binaries for Mac OS X and the Windows platform. But, in case you're still unable to access 
it you can use this command to install it : `!pip install tk`

Also, you have to install the Pillow package manually using : `!pip install PILLOW`
